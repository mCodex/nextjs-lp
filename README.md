# nextjs-lp

## About

A project made using:

* NextJS
* React Hooks
* Semantic UI

I designed this project only for studying purposes. It's a simple dummy landing page that I'm building, testing and improving using the awesome [Lighthouse plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk?hl=en).
